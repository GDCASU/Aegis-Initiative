I included the Jelly's textures, but the materials aren't the same as blender, likely due to two factors
Jelly_emission has bloom in blender, this could likely be replicated as a scene setting or effect in unity.
Same for jelly_pink - it should emit some light, like jelly_emission, but still also reflect light, and not
just be a flat color.

note: the image files are like, a megabyte. If that's too big (depending on the amount on screen?)
feel free to half the resolution
